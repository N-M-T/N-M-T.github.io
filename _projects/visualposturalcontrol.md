My doctoral training revolved around assessing visual contributions to postural control in young 
and older adults during standing and locomotion, and the effects of eye movements. A focal point 
of the doctorate was bridging the gap between laboratory-based testing and realistic environments 
using inertial measurement units and mobile eye tracking. The research process led to dissemination 
of results through 3 high-impact peer-reviewed publications 
[[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00216/full), [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-017-4996-2), [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29689345/)], several conferences, and the local news. 
I was also awarded research project of the year at my host institution.
