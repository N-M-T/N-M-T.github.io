I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Liverpool John Moores University. I primarily research sensorimotor control of human movement, the influences of ageing and disease, and how these interact with environmental factors. My goal is to apply knowledge gained – bridging the gap between complex laboratory-based experiments and the real-world – to inform the design and use of built environments and technologies, thus improving functional mobility and reducing the risk of falls and fall-related injuries.
